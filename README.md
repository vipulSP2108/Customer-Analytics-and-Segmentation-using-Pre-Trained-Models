# Customer-Analytics-and-Segmentation-using-Pre-Trained-Models

**Customer Analytics and Segmentation Project**  
*Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar*  
*Jan 2025 - May 2025*  
- Conducted customer segmentation for 2000 customers in the FMCG industry under Prof. Marcos In√°cio Severo de Almeida, using K-means clustering, PCA, and hierarchical clustering on demographic data (e.g., Age, Income, Education).  
- Applied pre-trained models (scaler, PCA, K-means) to segment customers into four groups (Well-off, Career-Focused, Fewer-Opportunities, Standard) and analyzed purchase behaviors (frequency, brand preferences, revenue) using transactional data.  
- Utilized Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to preprocess data, reduce dimensionality via PCA (~80% variance retained), and visualize insights through heatmaps, boxplots, and bar plots.  
- Provided actionable marketing insights, aligning with STP framework, to optimize targeted campaigns (e.g., premium products for Well-off, discounts for Fewer-Opportunities).  
- Presented findings at IIT Gandhinagar in 2025, demonstrating expertise in data analytics, machine learning, and marketing strategy.
